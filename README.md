I'll translate it to English if needed.
choose option 1 (basic conversion) or 2 (bc base calculator with conversion) 
option 1 > input base which you are going to convert > input value of it > input base that you want it to be converted to (or bases, each one after space)
option 2 > input bases (each one after space) which will be used for calculations > input value of first base > input operator (+ - * /) > input value of second base > ... > ... > input base in which the result will be displayed
